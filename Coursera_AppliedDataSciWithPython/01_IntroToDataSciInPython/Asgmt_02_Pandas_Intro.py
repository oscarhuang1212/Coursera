Part 1
    The following code loads the olympics dataset (olympics.csv), 
        which was derrived from the Wikipedia entry on All Time Olympic Games Medals, and does some basic data cleaning.
    The columns are organized as # of Summer games, Summer medals, # of Winter games, Winter medals, 
        total # number of games, total # of medals. Use this dataset to answer the questions below.

Part 2
    For the next set of questions, we will be using census data from the United States Census Bureau.

    This dataset contains population data for counties and states in the US from 2010 to 2015. 
    See this document for a description of the variable names.

    The census dataset (census.csv) should be loaded as census_df. Answer questions using this as appropriate.
